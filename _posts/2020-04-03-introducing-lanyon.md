title: Traveling Salesperson Problem
---

### Introduction
Basically,the Traveling Salesperson Problem is looking for the shortest path for options.
In a list of given cities and the distances between each city, what is the possible shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

### Maps Example
In my case of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, I chose four American auto museums as my four destinations. Respectively, they are America's Car Museum, Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum, California Auto Museum, and The Henry Ford Museum.

There are three different routes in these four destinations, and I show these three different routes and the total mileage required in the following examples. Comparisons allow me to have the shortest and fastest route scenarios.

### Example One:

In my first scenario, in order, the places to travel are Simeone Foundation Auto Museum, The Henry Ford Museum, America's Car Museum, California AutoMotive Museum, and finally back to Simone Foundation Automotive Museum. The total mileages are 6455.

### Example Two:

In my second scenario, in order, the places to travel are Simeone Foundation Auto Museum, The Henry Ford Museum, California AutoMotive Museum, America's Car Museum, and finally back to Simone Foundation Automotive Museum. The total mileages are 6454 which is the shortest path.

### Example Three:

In my third scenario, in order, the places to travel are Simeone Foundation Auto Museum,California AutoMotive Museum, The Henry Ford Museum, America's Car Museum, and finally back to Simone Foundation Automotive Museum. The total mileages are 10285 which is the longest path.
